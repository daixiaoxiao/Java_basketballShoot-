# Java_basketballShoot
#### I am a huge basketball fan so by start up my java programming with a basketball shooting game. 
#### Using the MVC to seperate the model and view, add a clock to count down the time, every 15seconds is a round. 
#### the ball will bounce back if it hits the backboard. 
#### use "up" and "right" arrow key to adjust the force and press "s" to shoot.
#### connect to database and update the highsist score everytime player make a new record.
#### Sorry couldn't find a consecutive shooting image for Kawhi Lernald~~
