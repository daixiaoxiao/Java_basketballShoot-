# Java_basketballShoot
I am a huge basketball fan so by start up my java programming with a basketball shooting game. 
Using the MVC to seperate the model and view, add a clock to count down the time, every 15seconds is a round. the ball will bounce back if it hits the backboard. 
use "up" and "right" arrow key to adjust the force and press "s" to shoot.
connect to database and update the highsist score everytime player make a new record.
Sorry couldn't find a consecutive shooting image for Kawhi Lernald~~
